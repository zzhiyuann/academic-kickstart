I am Zhiyuan Wang, an undergraduate student major in Computer Science at [Xiamen University](https://en.xmu.edu.cn/) (XMU). In 2021 Fall, I will move to University of Virginia to pursue my Ph.D. degree. Before that, I will take a research internship in Baidu Research about a half year. My research interests include data mining, pervasive computing, and machine learning.
