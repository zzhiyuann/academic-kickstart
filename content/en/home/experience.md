We propose a crowdsensing trend-based framework to accurately predict over-demand stations in bikesharing systems based on trend and effectively incentivize the users to help rebalancing bike based on the needs of the real world.

  * Propose an adaptive algorithm to extract the temporal pattern of the trend in bike stations innovatively.

  * Conduct evaluation experiments of the paper, including the baselines and the BikeNet we proposed.

  * A paper "RedPacketBike: Deep Bike Demand Forecast and Crowd-Driven Station Rebalancing for Bike Sharing Systems" is on submission to Ubicomp conference.
