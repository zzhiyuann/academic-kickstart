We propose a crowdsensing trend-based framework to accurately predict over-demand stations in bikesharing systems based on trend and effectively incentivize the users to help rebalancing bike based on the needs of the real world.

  * Process the raw data from SQL database into temporal sequence with MySQL and Pandas. 

  * Propose an adaptive algorithm to extract the temporal pattern of the trend in bike stations innovatively.

  * Conduct evaluation experiments of the paper, including the baselines and the BikeNet we proposed.

We propose a spatiotemporal graph neural network (ST-GNN) model to accurately model and forecast the fine-grained hospital visit demand from real-world human mobility data. Then exploit an effective hospital windows scheduling strategy using queuing theory.

- Propose the project idea and write the main body of the paper.

- Classify the urban functional areas and extract the human flow in hospitals by using improved machine learning algorithm and co-training framework with multi-source data fusion. 

- Build a spatialtemporal graph neural network to predict hospital visit demand with Tensorflow.
